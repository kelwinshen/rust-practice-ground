# ü¶Ä Rust Practice Ground

This is my personal playground for learning and experimenting with the [official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).  
I created this repo to test examples and concepts step by step as I go through the Rust Book.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This repo is organized into two main directories:

### `hello_world/`  
This folder contains foundational examples and concepts based on chapters from the Rust Book.  
Each file explores a specific concept, feature, or property of the Rust programming language.

Example files:

hello_world/main0.rs
hello_world/main1.rs
hello_world/main2.rs
...


These are meant to help **understand the core concepts and properties** of Rust in isolation.

### `hello_world_practice/`  
This folder contains **applied practice examples** using one or more properties learned from `hello_world/`.  
Each file focuses on how and when to use Rust features in real-world scenarios or combined logic.

Example files:

hello_world_practice/main0.rs
hello_world_practice/main1.rs
...


These are meant to **practice usage** and show how different Rust concepts work together.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Choose the directory (`hello_world/` or `hello_world_practice/`) based on whether you want to learn or practice.
2. Copy the desired file (e.g., `main3.rs`) into the `src/main.rs` of your Rust project.
3. Run the file:

   ```bash
   cargo run

Replace with another file as needed to test different topics.

üìò Learning Source
All examples and practices are based on:

The Rust Programming Language Book (a.k.a. "The Book")

üéØ Goals
Understand Rust‚Äôs core features through hands-on experimentation.

Practice combining features in realistic examples.

Build strong Rust fundamentals before moving on to advanced topics or full projects.
