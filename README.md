# ðŸ¦€ Rust Practice Ground

This is my personal playground for learning and experimenting with the [official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).  
I created this repo to test examples and concepts step by step as I go through the Rust Book.

Each Rust experiment or example is saved as a separate file:

main.rs
main0.rs
main1.rs
main2.rs
.
.
.

When I want to run a specific example, I manually copy the content of one of these files into `src/main.rs` and run the project by call cargo run in the specific directory.
